      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the API route refactoring task into subtasks covering: 1) Code analysis and route mapping, 2) Implementation of new route with redirect mechanism, 3) Frontend updates and testing, 4) Documentation updates",
      "reasoning": "This task has clearly defined steps with moderate technical complexity. The cyclomatic complexity is low as it involves straightforward route changes with minimal decision points. The task is well-structured with explicit implementation steps and testing requirements."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Portrait Revision UI implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Parameter adjustment form components, 2) Side-by-side comparison view, 3) Version history navigation, 4) Gallery integration, 5) Responsive design implementation, 6) Accessibility compliance",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating complex UI components with interactive elements, state management, and integration with existing systems. The cyclomatic complexity is high due to numerous user interactions and conditional rendering scenarios. Multiple interconnected components increase the Halstead complexity."
