# Integration Stub Future Tasks Checklist Reminder

Whenever you modify `.env.local` or any configuration file (e.g., `src/**/*config.ts`) to stub or fallback environment variables, API keys, or settings:

- Review and update [`docs/checklist/future-tasks.md`](mdc:../docs/checklist/future-tasks.md).
- Ensure all generic checklist items are addressed (e.g., replace dummy keys, remove stub logic, add integration tests).
- Remove this stub and restore strict validation for real production credentials.

This rule helps track outstanding cleanup tasks and prevents forgetting to swap dummy values for real credentials before deployment.
