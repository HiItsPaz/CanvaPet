- **Update MANUAL_SETUP.md After Implementing Code Changes**
  - When a task or subtask affects interface with Supabase or environment requirements, the manual setup document must be updated
  - Review and update after each completed task that modifies database schema, authentication, or environment configuration
  - Ensure any manual steps remain clear and accurate for team members or future developers

- **Elements to Keep Updated:**
  - **Database Schema Changes**
    - When tables, columns, or relationships are modified in code, update corresponding setup instructions
    - Ensure SQL definitions in documentation match actual implementation
    - Example: If adding a `description` column to the `pets` table in code, add it to the table definition in MANUAL_SETUP.md

  - **Environment Variables**
    - Add any new environment variables to both `.env.local` and `.env.example` sections
    - Include clear descriptions of what each variable is used for
    - Example: 
      ```
      # New variable for AI service
      NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_SERVICE_KEY=your-ai-service-key
      ```

  - **Supabase Configuration**
    - Update RLS policies when access patterns change
    - Document new storage buckets and their required policies
    - Update auth provider settings when authentication options change

  - **Verification Steps**
    - Add any new verification steps needed to confirm proper setup
    - Update testing procedures if they've changed during implementation

- **Update Process:**
  - After completing a task, compare your implementation with MANUAL_SETUP.md
  - Make documentation changes in the same PR as code changes
  - Add a checklist item to PR templates: "MANUAL_SETUP.md updated if needed"
  - When updating:
    - Maintain the same section structure
    - Use clear, step-by-step instructions
    - Include code examples where helpful
    
- **Review Completeness Periodically:**
  - Schedule monthly reviews of MANUAL_SETUP.md for comprehensiveness
  - Ensure onboarding a new developer would be possible using just the manual
  - Test the setup process on a clean environment occasionally to verify accuracy
