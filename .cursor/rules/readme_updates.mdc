# README Update Guidelines

## Update After Task Completion

- **Always update the README when a task is completed**
  - Document what was implemented
  - Highlight key features and components
  - Include brief technical details when relevant

## README Structure

- **Project Header** - Keep the title and add a short description
- **Features** - List main features implemented so far
- **Components** - Document implemented UI components
- **Technical Stack** - List technologies used
- **Implementation Progress** - Track completed tasks and upcoming work

## Update Format

```markdown
## Recent Updates

### Task X.Y: Task Name (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Implemented [feature]
- Created [component] for [purpose]
- Added [technical detail]
```

## Best Practices

- **Keep Updates Concise** - Focus on what was implemented, not how
- **Use Markdown Properly** - Organize with headers, lists, and code blocks
- **Include Screenshots When Relevant** - For UI components (store in `/public/screenshots`)
- **Maintain Chronological Order** - Most recent updates at the top
- **Cross-Reference Tasks** - Reference task IDs from Task Master
