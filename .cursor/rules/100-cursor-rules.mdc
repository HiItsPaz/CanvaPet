# Cursor MDC Rules Guidelines

## Required Rule Structure
```markdown
---
description: Clear, one-line description of what the rule enforces
globs: ["path/to/files/*.ext", "other/path/**/*"]
alwaysApply: boolean
---

# Main Title

## Section Headings
- Key points as bullet lists
- Include both good and bad examples
```

## File References
- Use `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` to reference files
- Example: [core.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/000-core.mdc) for rule references
- Example: [schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma) for code references

## Code Examples
- Use language-specific code blocks
```typescript
// ✅ DO: Show good examples
const goodExample = true;

// ❌ DON'T: Show anti-patterns
const badExample = false;
```

## Rule Content Guidelines
- Start with high-level overview
- Include specific, actionable requirements
- Show examples of correct implementation
- Reference existing code when possible
- Keep rules DRY by referencing other rules

## Rule Maintenance
- Update rules when new patterns emerge
- Add examples from actual codebase
- Remove outdated patterns
- Cross-reference related rules

## Best Practices
- Use bullet points for clarity
- Keep descriptions concise
- Include both DO and DON'T examples
- Reference actual code over theoretical examples
- Use consistent formatting across rules

## Rule Numbering System
- Use numeric prefixes to control loading order:
  - 000-099: Core principles and standards
  - 100-199: Meta rules and guidelines
  - 200-599: Project-specific rules
  - 600-799: Environment and deployment rules
  - 800-999: Documentation rules

See [self-improve.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/300-self-improve.mdc) for guidelines on evolving these rules over time.
