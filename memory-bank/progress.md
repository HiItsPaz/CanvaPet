# Progress

## Project Status
The CanvaPet project is in the documentation setup phase. The Memory Bank has been initiated to provide context for future development work.

## Completed
- âœ… Initialized Memory Bank structure
- âœ… Created foundational documentation files
- âœ… Defined project architecture and technical stack

## In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Exploring existing codebase to validate assumptions
- ðŸ”„ Documenting current implementation details
- ðŸ”„ Establishing development workflows

## Upcoming Tasks
- ðŸ“‹ Review and catalog existing components
- ðŸ“‹ Verify AI integration implementation
- ðŸ“‹ Document e-commerce flow
- ðŸ“‹ Review authentication system
- ðŸ“‹ Analyze test coverage

## Issues and Blockers
No known blockers at this time. The memory bank setup will provide the necessary context for further development.
