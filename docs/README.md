# CanvaPet Documentation

This directory contains the technical documentation for the CanvaPet project.

## Structure

The documentation is organized into the following sections:

- `components/` - Documentation for React components used in the project
  - `ui/` - UI component documentation
  - (Additional component categories will be added as needed)
- (Additional sections will be added as the project evolves)

## Navigation

- Start with [index.md](index.md) for an overview of available documentation
- Browse specific component documentation in the respective folders

## Contributing

When adding new documentation:

1. Place files in the appropriate directory based on content type
2. Use descriptive filenames and follow the established Markdown format
3. Add links to new documentation in the main [index.md](index.md) file
4. Use code examples with syntax highlighting where appropriate

### Documentation Format

Each documentation file should include:

- A clear title and description
- A table of contents for longer documents
- Code examples with proper syntax highlighting
- Links to related documentation when relevant
- Usage guidelines and best practices

## Viewing the Documentation

The documentation is written in Markdown format and can be viewed:

1. Directly on GitHub
2. Using any Markdown viewer or editor
3. Via a documentation site if one is set up in the future

## Future Improvements

- Integration with a documentation site generator (like Docusaurus or Nextra)
- Adding diagrams and visual guides
- API documentation for backend services
