# Critical Rendering Path (CRP) Analysis

**Date of Analysis:** `YYYY-MM-DD`

**Analyst:** `Your Name/Team`

**Subtask:** 16.1 - Critical Rendering Path Analysis

## 1. Objective

To analyze the current critical rendering path of key application pages to identify bottlenecks in DOM construction, CSSOM construction, render tree formation, layout, and paint processes. This analysis will serve as a baseline for optimization efforts.

## 2. Methodology

Browser developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools Performance tab, Network tab) were used to capture and analyze the rendering sequence for the selected key pages.

## 3. Key Pages Analyzed

*   Landing Page (`/`)
*   Pets Overview Page (`/pets`)
*   Merchandise Customization Page (`/merch/[blueprintId]/customize` - use a sample ID)
*   *(Add any other critical pages)*

## 4. Baseline Metrics (per page)

For each page analyzed, document the following baseline metrics:

### Page: [Page Name/URL]

*   **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** `value ms`
*   **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** `value ms`
*   **Time to First Byte (TTFB):** `value ms`
*   **Total Page Size:** `value KB/MB`
*   **Number of Requests:** `value`

*(Repeat for each key page)*

## 5. Analysis of Rendering Sequence & Bottlenecks (per page)

For each page analyzed, provide details on:

### Page: [Page Name/URL]

*   **Render-Blocking Resources:**
    *   List JavaScript files (`<script src="...">`, inline scripts without `async`/`defer`).
    *   List CSS files (`<link rel="stylesheet" href="...">`).
    *   Note their size and load times.
*   **Server Response Times:** (Refer to TTFB)
*   **Resource Sizes:**
    *   HTML document size.
    *   Key CSS file sizes.
    *   Key JavaScript bundle sizes (main chunk, page-specific chunks).
*   **DOM Construction Time:** `value ms` (approximate, from Performance tab)
*   **CSSOM Construction Time:** `value ms` (approximate, related to CSS download/parse)
*   **Layout Time:** `value ms` (total from Performance tab summary for initial load)
*   **Paint Time:** `value ms` (total from Performance tab summary for initial load)
*   **Identified Bottlenecks:**
    *   *(e.g., Large render-blocking JS bundle, slow CSS delivery, multiple font files blocking rendering, long main-thread tasks during initial load, etc.)*

*(Repeat for each key page)*

## 6. Visual Diagram of Critical Path (Conceptual)

*(This section is for a conceptual diagram or description. You can describe the general flow or embed an image if using a tool that supports it.)*

**Example Description:**
1.  Request HTML document.
2.  Server responds (TTFB).
3.  Browser parses HTML, discovers CSS and JS links.
4.  Requests CSS (render-blocking).
5.  Requests JS (potentially render-blocking if not `async`/`defer`).
6.  CSS downloads, CSSOM is built.
7.  JS downloads and executes (may modify DOM/CSSOM).
8.  Render Tree is built.
9.  Layout/Reflow.
10. Paint.

*(Adapt based on findings for this application, highlighting parallel downloads vs. blocking resources)*

## 7. Summary of Findings & Key Areas for Optimization

*   Overall assessment of the current CRP.
*   List the top 3-5 most impactful bottlenecks identified across the key pages.
*   Initial recommendations for addressing these bottlenecks (to be detailed further in subsequent optimization subtasks like 16.2, 16.3, etc.).
